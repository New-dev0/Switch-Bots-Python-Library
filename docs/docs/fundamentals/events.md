# Events

PySwitch is an event-driven framework. This means that the framework is designed to respond to events. Events are the primary way that PySwitch interacts with the outside world. Events are generated by the network, by the user, or by the framework itself. Events are handled by [handlers](./handlers).

## Event types

There are several types of events that can be handled by PySwitch:

### Chat events

- `MessageEvent` - A message was sent to a chat.
- `ComandEvent` - A command was sent to a chat.
- `CallbackQueryEvent` - A query callback was sent (user pressed a button, for example).

### Community events
