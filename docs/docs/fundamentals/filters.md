# Event filters

Filters are used to filter events before they are passed to the handler. Filters are used to filter events by their type, by the user that triggered the event, by the community, by the channel, etc.

When a filter is used, the handler will only be called if the event passes the filter.

You can use multiple filters in a single handler, using the unary operators `&` and `|`.

To add a filter to a handler, add the filter as a parameter to the handler class.

## Filter types

- `self`  Filter messages generated by the same user.
- `is_bot` Filter messages coming from bots.
- `me` Filter messages coming from your user.
- `incoming` Filter incoming messages. Messages that are sent to the users recipient.
- `outgoing` Filter outgoing messages. Messages that are sent by the user.
- `community` Filter events coming from a specific community.
- `channel` Filter events coming from a specific channel.
- `group` Filter events coming from a specific group.
- `user` Filter events coming from a specific user.
- `text` Filter messages that contain a specific text.
- `regex` Filter messages that match a specific regex.

## Filter examples

```python
from switch import BotApp, MessageHandler, is_bot, community, channel, user, text, regex

app = BotApp("token", "your bot description")

@app.on_message(is_bot & (community("123456789") | channel("123456")))
async def message_handler(ctx: BotContext[MessageEvent]):
    m = await ctx.prepare_response_message(ctx.event.message)
    m.message = f"Thank you! I received your message: {ctx.event.message.message}"
    await ctx.send_message(m)

app.run()
```
